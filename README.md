## Temperature and Precipitation Analysis for June and Dec
  
1. Average temp for June is approx 75 as compared to Decemeber which is 71. Hence June seems to be warmer than Dec which makes it ideal for surf and ice cream business.
  
2. As per the data, December gets more rain with an approx average of 0.22 as compared to June which gets about 0.14. Hence, June seems to be a better month to attract more business.
  
3. Looking at the histogram, out of 1700 data points, 1450 data points have temperatures of above 72 degrees for June for all stations in all years. Whereas in dec, only about 650 data points out of 1517 are above 72 degrees. Again, June seems to be more ideal for surf and ice cream shop.
  
## Recommendations for further analysis
  
1. If we had data about any existing competitiors around a station, it would help in deciding the pricing and budgeting to be more competitive.
  
2. It will be nice to know the wind speed as data points because that could affect the temperature and hence the business.
  
3. If we had more info about the station - example rocky or sandy or kid friendly - this would help understand how much and what kind traffic the station could pull.
  
4. It will be nice to gather data about the age group and surfing experience of people coming to the station and use this data to see if the station could introduce lessons and equipments accordingly which could result in addtional business oppurtunity.
